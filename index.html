    <h1 class="centre">My Recipies</h1>
    <p class="center">If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we’d all be much happier. However, unlike
        food based
        recipes, life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives their unique life. It means we
        must ‘cook’ with what we have and see what we can come up with it. Depending on our knowledge of our ingredients
        and the objective we wish to will establish how difficult it would be to ‘cook up’ our desired results.</p>
